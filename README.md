# Tom & Jerry Game
Its a fun word game. Give it a try.

Coded in python. 

Its a four letter word game, currently I added some 4 letter words as strings in the code, you can also have the words in a text file in drive.

# GAME RULES

The rules are simple. I will choose a four letter 'WORD' for you, you just have to guess it right.
Please remember, the letters in the 'WORD' will not repeat i.e., every letter in the 'WORD' will be unique.
You will be asked to input a 4 letter word(with no repeating letters) every turn, till you lose all your lives. Lives are the number of turns/guesses you get.
You can choose the difficulty at the beginning of the game. <<< Beginner - 15 lives/turns | Intermediate - 10 lives/turns | Expert - 5 lives/turns >>>
If any of the letters in the word you input, matches with the 'WORD' I chose,\nI will tell you the number of toms and jerries in the input word.
Sometimes, none of the letters in the input word might match with the 'WORD' I chose for you.
Toms are those letters whose positions are correct while Jerries are those letters whose positions are changed.

# Here's an example,
  'WORD' I chose for you = soup 
  input word you enteted = surf
  Here, there is 1 Tom and 1 Jerry...
  Letter 's' is the Tom since it is in same position <position-1> while, the letter 'u' is Jerry as its position in input word is <position2> but in actual 'WORD' it is in <position3>
  
You will have to guess/analyse which letters might be toms or jerries and choose a wise word with tom/jerry letters in your next turn.
You will WIN if you guess the 'WORD' I chose for you or LOSE when you lose all your lives.
Hope you got the rules Champ! Try out the game once, you will understand as you play. Its not rocket science, but might get you addicted.
